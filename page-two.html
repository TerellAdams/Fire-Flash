      Wildfires in California have been getting progressively worse every year. 
      In 2018, we had 8,527 wild fires in the past year! 
      1,893,913 acres were burned: forests, homes, buildings, and many lives lost. This past year more there was more than $3.5 billion lost in damages.
      These fires caused thousands of tons of Carbon Dioxide to pollute our California air. 
      All these fires were caused by human actions: explosions, burning cigarettes, and extreme heat which is caused by Green House Gas emissions.
